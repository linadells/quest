# Quest

This is my pet project made on Flutter. With this app, you will be able to create quests and share them with others. Other people will play them and compete with each other using their phones and scanning QR codes to see questions. All competitors will see their rate at the end of the game, and see the winner. 
# Quest App

This is my pet project made on Flutter. I am currently working on it. I`m using Firebase, Bloc, GoRouter, GetIt and other packages in this project.

With this platform you will be able to:

- **Create** quests with unique questions.
- **Play** the quests by scanning QR codes to reveal the questions.
- **Compete** with other players in real-time.
- **View Results**: At the end of the game, all players can see their rankings, and the winner is announced.
